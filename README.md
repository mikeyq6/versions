# versions
A small tool to identify version numbers and names of Singletrack Core releases

To use, clone the repository and run `make`

Add a reference to it in your PATH variable or copy it to `/usr/local/bin/` to make it available everywhere

Usage:

```versions [name]```

eg:

`versions Galibier`

`Version for Galibier is '2021.3'`

or in reverse:

`versions 2022.1` or `versions 20221`

`Version for 2022.1 is 'Iseran'`
